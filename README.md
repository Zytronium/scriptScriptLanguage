# ScriptScript Code
##### Experimental WIP interpreted language

---
This project, called ScriptScript, is an experiment with creating an interpreted
language like Python, or my previous unfinished attempt, "Katlin" (which was
written in Kotlin). This language will be written in C.

---
How to compile the ScriptScript interpreter:
`gcc main.c -pedantic -std=gnu11 -o scscrun`

How to compile/run a ScriptScript script: 
`./scscrun file.scsc`

Preferred file extension:
`.scsc`
